# iVoteSimulator
CS 3560 Project 1: iVoteSimulator
This console-based project is designed to simulate live-polling.

Numbers are randomly generated to choose key features, including: number of students, question type, number of answer choices for each question (not including True/False questions, which only have two answer choices), number of answer resubmissions from students

After running SimulationDriver, the user will be presented with: number of students questioned in the poll, type of question the students answered, list of all possible answer choices given to students, number of times students resubmitted their answers after casting their initial votes, final total of number of votes received for each answer choice
